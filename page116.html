                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. cutting in and out</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Flies, bees, beetles, wasps, and other insects are segmented creatures—head, thorax, and abdomen. Where these parts join, there appears to the imaginative eye a “cutting in” of the body.
                        <br> Hence the branch of zoology dealing with insects is aptly named <i>entomology</i>, from Greek
                        <i>en-</i>, in, plus <i>tome</i>, a cutting. The adjective is <i>entomological</i>.<br> (The word <i>insect</i> makes the same point—it is built on Latin <i>in-</i> in, plus sectus, a form of the verb meaning to cut.)<br> The prefix
                        <i>ec-,</i> from Greek <i>ek-</i>, means out. (The Latin prefix, you will recall, is <i>ex-</i>.) Combine <i>ec- </i>with <i>tome</i> to derive the words for surgical procedures in which parts are “cut out,” or removed: <i>tonsillectomy</i>                        (the tonsils), <i>appendectomy </i>(the appendix), <i>mastectomy</i> (the breast),
                        <i> hysterectomy </i>(the uterus), <i>prostatectomy </i>(the prostate), etc.<br> Combine <i>ec- </i>with Greek <i>kentron,</i> center (the Latin root, as we have discovered, is centrum), to derive <i>eccentric </i>—out of the center,
                        hence deviating from the normal in behavior, attitudes, etc., or unconventional, odd, strange. The noun is<i> eccentricity</i>.</p>


                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. more cuts</h3>
                    <p class="main_para">The Greek prefix a- makes a root negative; the <i>atom</i> was so named at a time when it was considered the smallest possible particle of an element, that is, one that could not be cut any further. (We have long since split the atom,
                        of course, with results, as in most technological advances, both good and evil.) The adjective is <i>atomic</i>.<br> The Greek prefix <i>ana-</i> has a number of meanings, one of which is up, as in <i>anatomy</i>, originally the
                        cutting up of a plant or animal to determine its structure, later the bodily structure itself. The adjective is <i>anatomical </i>.<br> Originally any book that was part of a larger work of many volumes was called a <i>tome</i>                        —etymologically, a part cut from the whole. Today, a <i>tome</i> designates, often disparagingly, an exceptionally large book, or one that is heavy and dull in content.<br> The Greek prefix <i>dicha-</i>, in two, combines with
                        <i>tome</i> to construct <i>dichotomy</i>, a splitting in two, a technical word used in <i>astronomy</i>, biology, botany, and the science of logic. It is also employed as a non-technical term, as when we refer to the
                        <i>dichotomy </i>in the life of a man who is a government clerk all day and a night-school teacher after working hours, so that his life is, in a sense, split into two parts. The verb is
                        <i>dichotomize</i>; the adjective is <i>dichotomous</i>. <i>Dichotomous</i> thinking is the sort that divides everything into two parts—good and bad; white and black; Democrats and Republicans; etc. An unknown wit has made this
                        classic statement about
                        <i> dichotomous</i> thinking: “There are two kinds of people: those who divide everything into two parts, and those who do not.”<br> Imagine a book, a complicated or massive report, or some other elaborate document— now figuratively
                        cut on or through it so that you can get to its essence, the very heart of the idea contained in it. What you have is an <i>epitome </i>, a condensation of the whole. (From <i>epi-</i>, on, upon, plus <i>tome</i>. )<br>
                        <i>An epitome</i> may refer to a summary, condensation, or abridgment of language, as in “Let me have an <i>epitome </i>of the book,” or “Give me the <i>epitome </i>of his speech.” More commonly, <i>epitome </i.>and the verb <i>epitomize</i>                        are used in sentences like “She is the <i>epitome</i> of kindness,” or “That one act <i>epitomizes</i> her philosophy of life.” If you cut everything else away to get to the essential part, that part is a representative crosssection
                        of the whole. So a woman who is the <i>epitome</i> of kindness stands for all people who are kind; and an act that <i>epitomizes</i> a philosophy of life represents, by itself, the complete philosophy.

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">3. love and words</h3>
                    <p class="main_para"><i>Logos</i>, we know, means <i>science or study</i>; it may also mean word or speech, as it does in
                        <i>philology</i>, etymologically the love of words (from Greek <i>philein</i>, to love, plus
                        <i>logos</i>), or what is more commonly called <i>linguistics</i>, the science of language, a term derived from Latin <i>lingua</i>, tongue.<br> Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective form of <i>philology</i>? __________________.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">4. more love</h3>
                    <p class="main_para"><i>Philanthropy</i> is by etymology the love of mankind—one who devotes oneself to <i>philanthropy </i>is a <i>philanthropist </i>; the adjective is <i>philanthropic</i>.<br> The verb <i>philander</i>, to “play around” sexually, be
                        promiscuous, or have extramarital relations, combines <i>philein</i> with <i>andros</i>, male. (<i>Philandering</i>, despite its derivation, is not of course exclusively the male province. The word is, in fact, derived from the
                        proper name conventionally given to male lovers in plays and romances of the 1500s and 1600s.) One who engages in the interesting activities catalogued above is a <i>philanderer</i>. By etymology, philosophy is the love of wisdom
                        (Greek <i>sophos</i>, wise); <i>Philadelphia</i> is the City of Brotherly Love (Greek <i>adelphos</i>, brother);<i> philharmonic</i> is the love of music or harmony (Greek <i>harmonia</i>, harmony); and a <i>philter</i>, a rarely
                        used word, is a love potion. Today we call whatever arouses sexual desire an <i>aphrodisiac</i>, from
                        <i>Aphrodite</i>, the Greek goddess of love and beauty.<br>
                        <i>Aphrodisiac</i> is an adjective as well as a noun, but a longer adjective form, <i>aphrodisiacal</i>, is also used.
                        <i>A bibliophile</i> is one who loves books as collectibles, admiring their binding, typography, illustrations, rarity, etc.—in short, a book collector. The combining root is Greek <i>biblion</i>, book.<br> An <i>Anglophile</i>                        admires and is fond of the British people, customs, culture, etc. The combining root is Latin <i>Anglus,</i> English.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">5. words and how they affect people</h3>
                    <p class="main_para">The <i>semanticist</i> is professionally involved in <i>semantics </i>. The adjective is
                        <i> semantic</i> or <i>semantical </i>.<br>
                        <i>Semantics</i>, like <i>orthopedics, pediatrics, and obstetrics,</i> is a singular noun despite the -s ending. <i>Semantics</i> is, not are, an exciting study. However, this rule applies only when we refer to the word as a science
                        or area of study. In the following sentence,<i> semantics</i> is used as a plural: “The <i>semantics</i> of your thinking are all wrong.” Two stimulating and highly readable books on the subject, well worth a visit to the library
                        to pick up, are <i>Language </i>in Thought and Action, by S. I. Hayakawa, and <i>People in Quandaries</i>, by Dr. Wendell Johnson.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">6. how people live</h3>
                    <p class="main_para">The profession of the <i>sociologist</i> is <i>sociology </i>. Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective? __________________.<br>
                        <i>Sociology </i>is built on Latin <i>socius</i>, companion, plus <i>logos</i>, science, study. <i>Socius </i>is the source of such common words as <i>associate, social, socialize, society, sociable,</i> and <i>antisocial</i>;
                        as well as <i>asocial</i>, which combines the negative prefix <i>a-</i> with <i>socius</i>.<br>
                        <i>The antisocial</i> person actively dislikes people, and often behaves in ways that are detrimental or destructive to society or the social order (<i>anti-</i>, against).<br> On the other hand, someone who is <i>asocial </i>is
                        withdrawn and self-centered, avoids contact with others, and feels completely indifferent to the interests or welfare of society. The
                        <i>asocial</i> person doesn’t want to “get involved.”</p>
