                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. depends how you turn</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Introvert, extrovert, and ambivert</i> are built on the Latin verb verto, to turn. If your thoughts are constantly turned inward (<i>intro-</i>), you are an <i>introvert</i>; outward (<i>extro-</i>), an <i>extrovert</i>; and in
                        both directions (<i>ambi-</i>), an <i>ambivert</i>. The prefix <i>ambi-</i>, both, is also found in
                        <i>ambidextrous</i>, able to use both hands with equal skill. The noun is
                        <i>ambidexterity</i>.<br>
                        <i>Dexterous</i> means skillful, the noun <i>dexterity</i> is skill. The ending <i>-ous</i> is a common adjective suffix (famous, dangerous, perilous, etc.); <i>-ity</i> is a common noun suffix (vanity, quality, simplicity, etc.).<br>                        (Spelling caution: Note that the letter following the t- in <i>ambidextrous</i> is -r, but that in
                        <i>dexterous</i> the next letter is -e. )<br>
                        <i>Dexter</i> is actually the Latin word for right hand—in the <i>ambidextrous</i> person, both hands are right hands, so to speak.<br> The right hand is traditionally the more skillful one; it is only within recent decades that
                        we have come to accept that “lefties” or “southpaws” are just as normal as anyone else— and the term left-handed is still used as a synonym of awkward.<br> The Latin word for the left hand is sinister. This same word, in English,
                        means threatening, evil, or dangerous, a further commentary on our early suspiciousness of left-handed persons. There may still be some parents who insist on forcing left-handed children to change (though left-handedness is inherited,
                        and as much an integral part of its possessor as eye color or nose shape), with various unfortunate results to the child—sometimes stuttering or an inability to read with normal skill.<br> The French word for the left hand is<i> gauche</i>,
                        and, as you would suspect, when we took this word over into English we invested it with an uncomplimentary meaning. Call someone
                        <i>gauche</i> and you imply clumsiness, generally social rather than physical. (We’re right back to our age-old misconception that left-handed people are less skillful than righthanded ones.) A <i>gauche</i> remark is tactless;
                        a <i>gauche</i> offer of sympathy is so bumbling as to be embarrassing; <i>gaucherie</i> is an awkward, clumsy, tactless, embarrassing way of saying things or of handling situations. The <i>gauche</i> person is totally without
                        finesse.
                        <br> And the French word for the right hand is droit, which we have used in building our English word <i>adroit. Needless to say, <i>adroit</i>, like <i>dexterous</i>, means skillful, but especially in the exercise of the mental
                        facilities. Like <i>gauche, adroit,</i> or its noun <i>adroitness</i>, usually is used figuratively. The <i>adroit</i> person is quickwitted, can get out of difficult spots cleverly, can handle situations ingeniously. <i>Adroitness</i>                        is, then, quite the opposite of gaucherie.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. love, hate, and marriage</h3>
                    <p class="main_para"><i>Misanthrope, misogynist, and misogamist</i> are built on the Greek root <i>misein</i>, to hate. The
                        <i>misanthrope</i> hates mankind (Greek <i>anthropos</i>, mankind); the <i>misogynist</i> hates women (Greek
                        <i>gyne</i>, woman); the <i>misogamist</i> hates marriage (Greek <i>gamos</i>, marriage).<br>
                        <i>Anthropos</i>, mankind, is also found in <i>anthropology</i>, the study of the development of the human race; and in <i>philanthropist</i>, one who loves mankind and shows such love by making substantial financial contributions
                        to charitable organizations or by donating time and energy to helping those in need.<br> The root <i>gyne</i>, woman, is also found in <i>gynecologist,</i> the medical specialist who treats female disorders. And the root <i>gamos</i>,
                        marriage, occurs also in <i>monogamy, bigamy,</i> and <i>polygamy</i>.<br> (As we will discover later, <i>monos</i> means one, <i>bi-</i> means two, <i>polys</i> means many. ) So <i>monogamy</i> is the custom of only one marriage
                        (at a time).<br>
                        <i>Bigamy,</i> by etymology, is two marriages—in actuality, the unlawful act of contracting another marriage without divorcing one’s current legal spouse. An d polygamy, by derivation many marriages, and therefore etymologically
                        denoting plural marriage for either males or females, in current usage generally refers to the custom practiced in earlier times by the Mormons, and before them by King Solomon, in which the man has as many wives as he can aϱord
                        ϧnancially and/or emotionally. The correct, but rarely used, term for this custom is polygyny —polys, many, plus gyne, woman. What if a woman has two or more husbands, a form of marriage practiced in the Himalaya Mountains of Tibet?
                        That custom is called polyandry, from polys plus Greek andros, male.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">3. making friends with suffixes</h3>
                    <p>English words have various forms, using certain suffixes for nouns referring to persons, other suffixes for practices, attitudes, philosophies, etc, and still others for adjectives. Consider:</p>
                    <!-- <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Person &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Practice, etc. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Adjective
                        <br>1. misanthrope or misanthropist misanthropy misanthropic
                        <br>2. misogynist misogyny misogynous or misogynistic
                        <br>3. gynecologist gynecology gynecological
                        <br>4. monogamist monogamy monogamous
                        <br>5. bigamist bigamy bigamous
                        <br>6. polygamist polygamy polygamous
                        <br>7. polygynist polygyny polygynous
                        <br>8. polyandrist polyandry polyandrous
                        <br>9. philanthropist philanthropy philanthropic
                        <br>10. anthropologist anthropology anthropological
                        <br>You will note, then, that -ist is a common suϫx for a person; -y for a practice, attitude, etc.; and -ic or -ous for an adjective. -->

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">4. living alone and liking it</h3>
                    <p>Ascetic is from the Greek word asketes, monk or hermit. A monk lives a lonely life—not for him the pleasures of the ϩeshpots, the laughter and merriment of convivial gatherings, the dissipation of high living. Rather, days of contemplation,
                        study, and rough toil, nights on a hard bed in a simple cell, and the kind of self-denial that leads to a purification of the soul. That person is an ascetic who leads an existence, voluntarily of course, that compares in austerity,
                        simplicity, and rigorous hardship with the life of a monk. The practice is asceticism, the adjective ascetic.</p>
