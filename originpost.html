                    <p>Egoist and egotist are built on the same Latin root-the pronoun ego, meaning I. I is the greatest concern in the egoist's mind, the most overused word in the egotist's vocabulary.Ego itself has been taken over from Latin as an important
                        English word and is commonly used to denote one's concept of oneself, as in, "What do you think your constant criticisms do to my ego?" If you are an egocentric, you consider yourself the center of the universe-you are an extreme
                        form of the egoist. And if you are an egomaniac, you carry egoism to such an extreme that your needs, desires, and interests have become a morbid obsession, a mania. The egoist or egotist is obnoxious, the egocentric is intolerable,
                        and the egomaniac is dangerous and slightly mad. Egocentric is both a noun ("What an egocentric her new room- mate is!") and an adjective ("He is the most egocentric person I have ever met!"). To derive the adjective form of egomaniac,
                        add -al, a common adjective suffix. egomaniacal</p>
