                    <h2 class="section-heading">IDEAS</h2>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. me first</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Your attitude to life is simple, direct, and aboveboard-every decision you- make is based on the answer to one question: "What's in it for me?" If your selfishness, greed, and ruthless desire for self-advancement hurt other people,
                        that's too bad. "This is a tough world, pal, dog eat dog and all that, and I, for one, am not going to be left behind!"</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">An Egoist</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. the height of conceit</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">“Now, let’s see. Have you heard about all the money I’m making? Did I tell you about my latest amorous conquest? Let me give you my opinion—I know, because I’m an expert at practically everything!” You are boastful to the point of
                        being obnoxious—you have only one string to your conversational violin, namely, yourself; and on it you play a number of monotonous variations: what you think, what you have done, how good you are, how you would solve the problems
                        of the world, etc. ad nauseam.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">An egotist</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">3. let me help you</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Your attitude to life is simple, direct, and aboveboard-every decision you- make is based on the answer to one question: "What's in it for me?" If your selfishness, greed, and ruthless desire for self-advancement hurt other people,
                        that's too bad. "This is a tough world, pal, dog eat dog and all that, and I, for one, am not going to be left behind!"</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">An altruist</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">4. leave me alone</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Like a biochemist studying a colony of bacteria under the microscope, you minutely examine your every thought, feeling, and action. Probing, futile questions like “What do other people think of me?”, “How do I look?”, and “Maybe I
                        shouldn’t have said that?” are your constant nagging companions, for you are unable to realize that other people do not spend as much time and energy analyzing you as you think.<br> You may seem unsocial, yet your greatest desire
                        is to be liked and accepted. You may be shy and quiet, you are often moody and unhappy, and you prefer solitude or at most the company of one person to a crowd. You have an aptitude for creative work and are uncomfortable engaging
                        in activities that require cooperation with other people. You may even be a genius, or eventually turn into one.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">An introvert</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">5. let’s do it together</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">You would be great as a teacher, counselor, administrator, insurance agent. You can always become interested—sincerely, vitally interested—in other people’s problems. You’re the life of the party, because you never worry about the
                        effect of your actions, never inhibit yourself with doubts about dignity or propriety. You are usually happy, generally full of high spirits; you love to be with people—lots of people. Your thoughts, your interests, your whole
                        personality are turned outward.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">An extrovert</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">6. neither extreme</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">You have both introverted and extroverted tendencies—at different times and on different occasions. Your interests are turned, in about equal proportions, both inward and outward. Indeed, you’re quite normal—in the sense that your
                        personality is like that of most people.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">An ambivert</h2>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">7. people are no damn good</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Cynical, embittered, suspicious, you hate everyone. (Especially, but never to be admitted, yourself?) The perfectibility of the human race? “Nonsense! No way!” The stupidity, the meanness, and the crookedness of most mortals (“Most?
                        Probably all!”)—that is your favorite theme.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">A misanthrope</h2>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">8. women are no damn good</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Sometime in your dim past, you were crossed, scorned, or deeply wounded by a woman (a mother, or mother figure, perhaps?). So now you have a carefully constructed defense against further hurt—you hate all women.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">A misogynist</h2>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">9. “marriage is an institution—and who wants to live in an institution?”</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">You will not make the ultimate legal commitment. Members of the opposite sex are great as lovers, roommates, apartment- or house-sharers, but not as lawfully wedded spouses. The ties that bind are too binding for you. You may possibly
                        believe, and possibly, for yourself, be right, that a commitment is deeper and more meaningful if freedom is available without judicial proceedings.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">A misogamist</h2>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">10. “… that the flesh is heir to …”</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Self-denial, austerity, lonely contemplation—these are the characteristics of the good life, so you claim. The simplest food and the least amount of it that will keep body and soul together, combined with abstinence from ϩeshly, earthly
                        pleasures, will eventually lead to spiritual perfection—that is your philosophy.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">An ascetic</h2>
