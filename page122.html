                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. equality</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">If you play golf, you know that each course or hole has a certain <i>par</i>, the number of strokes allowed according to the results achieved by expert players. Your own accomplishment on the course will be at <i>par</i>, above <i>par,</i>                        or below <i>par.</i><br> Similarly, some days you may feel up to <i>par,</i> other days below <i>par.</i><br>
                        <i>Par </i>is from a Latin word meaning <i>equal</i>. You may try, when you play golf, to <i>equal</i> the expert score; and some days you may, or may not, feel equal to your usual self.<br> When we speak of <i>parity</i> payments
                        to farmers, we refer to payments that show an
                        <i>equality</i> to earnings for some agreed-upon year.<br> So when you <i>disparage,</i> you lower someone’s <i>par,</i> or feeling of <i>equality</i>, (<i>dis-</i> as you know, may be a negative prefix). The noun is <i>disparagement</i>,
                        the adjective
                        <i>disparaging</i>, as in “Why do you always make <i>disparaging</i> remarks about me?”
                        <br>
                        <i>Parity</i> as a noun means <i>equality</i>; <i>disparity</i> means a lack of
                        <i>equality</i>, or a difference. We may speak, for example, of the <i>disparity</i> between someone’s promise and performance; or of the <i>disparity</i> between the rate of vocabulary growth of a child and of an adult. The adjective
                        <i>disparate</i> indicates essential or complete difference or inequality, as in “Our philosophies are so <i>disparate</i> that we can never come to any agreement on action.”<br> The word <i>compare</i> and all its forms (<i>comparable, comparative,</i>                        etc.) derive from <i>par,</i> equal. Two things are compared when they have certain <i>equal</i> or <i>similar</i> qualities, (<i>con-, com-,</i> together, with).<br>
                        <i>Pair</i> and <i>peer</i> are also from <i>par</i>. Things (shoes, socks, gloves, etc.) in <i>pairs</i> are <i>equal</i> or similar; your <i>peers</i> are those <i>equal</i> to you, as in age, position, rank, or ability. Hence
                        the expression “to be judged by a jury of one’s peers.”<br> (British <i>peers</i>, however, such is the contradiction of language, were <i>nobles.</i> )</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. how to say yes and no</h3>
                    <p class="main_para"><i>Equivocate</i> is built on another Latin word meaning <i>equal—aequus</i> (the spelling in English is always <i>equ-</i>)—plus <i>vox, vocis,</i> voice.<br> When you <i>equivocate</i>, you seem to be saying both <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>                        with <i>equal
                        voice</i>. An <i>equivocal</i> answer, therefore, is by design vague, indefinite, and susceptible of contradictory interpretations, quite the opposite of an <i>unequivocal</i> response, which says <i>Yes!</i> or <i>No!,</i> and
                        no kidding. Professional politicians are masters of <i>equivocation</i>—they are, on most vital issues, mugwumps; they sit on a fence with their <i>mugs</i> on one side and their <i>wumps</i> on the other. You will often hear candidates
                        for office say, publicly, that they <i>unequivocally</i> promise, if elected, to…; and then they start <i>equivocating</i> for all they are worth, like people who say, “Let me be perfectly <i>frank</i> with you”—and then promptly
                        and glibly lie through their teeth.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">3.statements of various kinds</h3>
                    <p class="main_para">Do not confuse <i>equivocal</i> with <i>ambiguous</i>. An <i>equivocal</i> statement is purposely, deliberately (and with malice aforethought) couched in language that will be deceptive; an <i>ambiguous</i> statement is <i>accidentally</i>                        couched in such language. <i>Equivocal</i> is, in short, purposely <i>ambiguous</i>.<br> You will recall that <i>ambi-</i>, which we last met in <i>ambivert</i> and <i>ambidextrous,</i> is a root meaning both; anything <i>ambiguous</i>                        may have both one meaning and another meaning. If you say, “That sentence is the height of <i>ambiguity</i>,” you mean that you find it vague because it admits of both affirmative and negative interpretations, or because it may
                        mean two different things.<br> Another type of statement or word contains the possibility of two interpretations—one of them suggestive, risqué, or sexy. Such a statement or word is a <i>double entendre</i>. This is from the French
                        and translates literally as <i>double meaning</i>.</p>
