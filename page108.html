                    <p align="justify"><i>Psychologist</i> is built upon the same Greek root as <i>psychiatrist—psyche</i>, spirit, soul, or mind. In <i>psychiatrist</i>, the combining form is iatreia, medical healing. In <i>psychologist</i>, the combining form is logos, science or study; a <i>psychologist</i>, by etymology, is one who studies the mind. The field is <i>psychology</i>, the adjective <i>psychological</i>.<br>
                        <i>Psyche</i> is also an English word in its own right—it designates the mental life, the spiritual or non-physical aspect of one’s existence. The adjective <i>psychic</i> refers to phenomena or qualities that cannot be explained in purely physical terms. People may be called <i>psychic</i> if they seem to possess a sixth sense, a special gift of mind reading, or any mysterious aptitudes that cannot be accounted for logically. A person’s disturbance is <i>psychic</i> if it is emotional or mental, rather than physical.<br>
                        <i>Psyche</i> combines with the Greek pathos, suϱering or disease, to form <i>psychopathic</i>, an adjective that describes someone suϱering from a severe mental or emotional disorder. The noun is <i>psychopathy</i>.<br>
                        The root <i>psyche</i> combines with Greek soma, body, to form <i>psychosomatic</i>, an adjective that delineates the powerful inϩuence that the mind, especially the unconscious, has on bodily diseases. Thus, a person who fears the consequence of being present at a certain meeting will suddenly develop a bad cold or backache, or even be injured in a traffic accident, so that his appearance at this meeting is made impossible. It’s a real cold, it’s far from an imaginary backache, and of course one cannot in any sense doubt the reality of the automobile that injured him. Yet, according to the <i>psychosomatic</i> theory of medicine, his unconscious made him susceptible to the cold germs, caused the backache, or forced him into the path of the car.<br>
                        A <i>psychosomatic</i> disorder actually exists insofar as symptoms are concerned (headache, excessive urination, pains, paralysis, heart palpitations), yet there is no organic cause within the body. The cause is within the <i>psyche</i>, the mind. Dr. Flanders Dunbar, in Mind and Body, gives a clear and exciting account of the interrelationship between emotions and diseases.<br>
                        <i>Psychoanalysis</i> relies on the technique of deeply, exhaustively probing into the unconscious, a technique developed by Sigmund Freud. In oversimplified terms, the general principle of <i>psychoanalysis</i> is to guide the patient to an awareness of the deepseated, unconscious causes of anxieties, fears, conflicts, and tension. Once found, exposed to the light of day, and thoroughly understood, claim the <i>psychoanalysts</i>, these causes may vanish like a light snow that is exposed to strong sunlight.<br>
                        Consider an example: You have asthma, let us say, and your doctor can find no physical basis for your ailment. So you are referred to a <i>psychoanalyst</i> (or <i>psychiatrist</i> or clinical <i>psychologist</i> who practices <i>psychoanalytically</i> oriented therapy).<br>
                        With your therapist you explore your past life, dig into your unconscious, and discover, let us say for the sake of argument, that your mother or father always used to set for you impossibly high goals. No matter what you accomplished in school, it was not good enough —in your mother’s or father’s opinion (and such opinions were always made painfully clear to you), you could do better if you were not so lazy. As a child you built up certain resentments and anxieties because you seemed unable to please your parent—and (this will sound farfetched, but it is perfectly possible) as a result you became asthmatic. How else were you going to get the parental love, the approbation, the attention you needed and that you felt you were not receiving?<br>
                        In your sessions with your therapist, you discover that your asthma is emotionally, rather than organically, based—your ailment is <i>psychogenic</i>, of <i>psychic</i> origin, or (the terms are used more or less interchangeably although they differ somewhat in definition) <i>psychosomatic</i>, resulting from the interaction of mind and body. (<i>Psychogenic</i> is built on <i>psyche</i> plus Greek <i>genesis</i>, birth or origin.)<br> 
                        And your treatment? No drugs, no surgery—these may help the body, not the emotions. Instead, you “work out” (this is the term used in <i>psychoanalytic</i> parlance) early trauma in talk, in remembering, in exploring, in interpreting, in reliving childhood experiences. And if your asthma is indeed <i>psychogenic</i> (or <i>psychosomatic</i>), therapy will very likely help you; your attacks may cease, either gradually or suddenly.<br>
                        Freudian therapy is less popular today than formerly; many newer therapies—Gestalt, bioenergetics, transactional analysis, to name only a few—claim to produce quicker results.<br>
                        In any case, <i>psychotherapy</i> of one sort or another is the indicated treatment for <i>psychogenic</i> (or <i>psychosomatic</i>) disorders, or for any personality disturbances.<br>
                        The practitioner is a <i>psychotherapist</i> or therapist, for short; the adjective is <i>psychotherapeutic</i>.</p>
