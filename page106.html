                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. the straighteners</h3>
                    <p align="justify">The orthopedist is so called from the Greek roots orthos, straight or correct, and paidos, child. The orthopedist, by etymology, straightens children. The term was coined in 1741 by the author of a textbook on the prevention of childhood
                        diseases—at that time the correction of spinal curvature in children was a main concern of practitioners of orthopedics.<br> Today the specialty treats deformities, injuries, and diseases of the bones and joints (of adults as well
                        as children, of course), often by surgical procedures.<br> Adjective: orthopedic.<br> Orthodontia, the straightening of teeth, is built on orthos plus odontos, tooth. The orthodontist specializes in improving your “bite,” retracting
                        “buck teeth,” and by means of braces and other techniques seeing to it that every molar, incisor, bicuspid, etc. is exactly where it belongs in your mouth.<br> Adjective: orthodontic.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. the heart</h3>
                    <p align="justify">Cardiologist combines Greek kardia, heart, and logos, science.<br> The specialty is cardiology (kahr-dee-OL′-Ə-jee), the adjective cardiological.<br> So a cardiac condition refers to some malfunctioning of the heart; a cardiogram is
                        an electrically produced record of the heartbeat. The instrument that produces this record is called a cardiograph.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">3. the nervous system</h3>
                    <p align="justify">Neurologist derives from Greek neuron, nerve, plus logos, science. Specialty: neurology; adjective: neurological.<br> Neuralgia is acute pain along the nerves and their branches; the word comes from neuron plus algos, pain.<br> Neuritis,
                        is inflammation of the nerves.<br> Neurosis, combining neuron with -osis, a suffix meaning abnormal or diseased condition, is not, despite its etymology, a disorder of the nerves, but rather, as described by the late Eric Berne,
                        a psychiatrist, “… an illness characterized by excessive use of energy for unproductive purposes so that personality development is hindered or stopped. A man who spends most of his time worrying about his health, counting his
                        money, plotting revenge, or washing his hands, can hope for little emotional growth.”<br> Neurotic is both the adjective form and the term for a person suϱering from neurosis.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">4. the mind</h3>
                    <p align="justify">A neurosis is not a form of mental unbalance. A full-blown mental disorder is called a psychosis, a word built on Greek psyche, spirit, soul, or mind, plus -osis. A true psychotic has lost contact with reality—at least with reality
                        as most of us perceive it, though no doubt psychotic (note that this word, like neurotic, is both a noun and an adjective) people have their own form of reality.<br> Built on psyche plus iatreia, medical healing, a psychiatrist
                        by etymology is a mind-healer. The specialty is psychiatry; the adjective is psychiatric.<br> Pediatrics, as you know, is also built on iatreia, as is podiatry, discussed in the next chapter, and geriatrics, the specialty dealing
                        with the particular medical needs of the elderly. (This word combines iatreia with Greek geras, old age.) The specialist is a geriatrician, the adjective is geriatric.</p>
