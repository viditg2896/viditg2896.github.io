                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. inside you</h3>
                    <p>Internist and internal derive from the same Latin root, internus, inside. The internist is a specialist in internal medicine, in the exploration of your insides. This physician determines the state of your internal organs in order
                        to discover what’s happening within your body to cause the troubles you’re complaining of.<br> Do not confuse the internist with the intern (also spelled interne), who is a medical graduate serving an apprenticeship inside a hospital.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. doctors for women</h3>
                    <p>The word gynecologist is built on Greek gyne, woman, plus logos, science; etymologically, gynecology is the science (in actual use, the medical science) of women. Adjective: gynecological.
                        <br> Obstetrician derives from Latin obstetrix, midwife, which in turn has its source in a Latin verb meaning to stand—midwives stand in front of the woman in labor to aid in the delivery of the infant.<br> The suffix -ician, as
                        in obstetrician, physician, musician, magician, electrician, etc., means expert.
                        <br> Obstetrics has only within the last 150 years become a respectable specialty. No further back than 1834, Professor William P. Dewees assumed the first chair of obstetrics at the University of Pennsylvania and had to brave
                        considerable medical contempt and ridicule as a result—the delivery of children was then considered beneath the dignity of the medical profession.<br> Adjective: obstetric or obstetrical.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">3. children</h3>
                    <p>Pediatrician is a combination of Greek paidos, child; iatreia, medical healing; and -ician, expert.
                        <br> Pediatrics, then, is by etymology the medical healing of a child.<br> Adjective: pediatric.<br> (The ped- you see in words like pedestal, pedal, and pedestrian is from the Latin pedis, foot, and despite the identical spelling
                        in English has no relationship to Greek paidos. ) Pedagogy, which combines paidos with agogos, leading, is, etymologically, the leading of children. And to what do you lead them? To learning, to development, to growth, to maturity.
                        From the moment of birth, infants are led by adults—they are taught, ϧrst by parents and then by teachers, to be self-suϫcient, to ϧt into the culture in which they are born. Hence, pedagogy, which by derivation means the leading
                        of a child, refers actually to the principles and methods of teaching. College students majoring in education take certain standard pedagogy courses—the history of education; educational psychology; the psychology of adolescents;
                        principles of teaching; etc. Adjective: pedagogical.<br> A pedagogue is versed in pedagogy. But pedagogue has an unhappy history. From its original, neutral meaning of teacher, it has deteriorated to the point where it refers,
                        today, to a narrow-minded, strait-laced, old-fashioned, dogmatic teacher. It is a word of contempt and should be used with caution.<br> Like pedagogue, demagogue has also deteriorated in meaning. By derivation a leader (agogos)
                        of the people (demos), a demagogue today is actually one who attempts, in essence, to mislead the people, a politician who foments discontent among the masses, rousing them to fever pitch by wild oratory, in an attempt to be voted
                        into office.<br> Once elected, demagogues use political power to further their own personal ambitions or fortunes.
                        <br> Many “leaders” of the past and present, in countries around the world, have been accused of demagoguery. Adjective: demagogic.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">4. skin-deep</h3>
                    <p>The dermatologist, whose specialty is dermatology, is so named from Greek derma, skin. Adjective: dermatological.<br> See the syllables derma in any English word and you will know there is some reference to skin—for example, a hypodermic
                        needle penetrates under (Greek, hypos) the skin; the epidermis is the outermost layer of skin; a taxidermist, whose business is taxidermy (TAKS′-Ə-dur-mee), prepares, stuϱs, and mounts the skins of animals; a pachyderm is an animal
                        with an unusually thick skin, like an elephant, hippopotamus, or rhinoceros; and dermatitis is the general name for any skin inflammation, irritation, or infection.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">5. the eyes have it</h3>
                    <p>Ophthalmologist—note the ph preceding th—is from Greek ophthalmos, eye, plus logos, science or study. The specialty is ophthalmology, the adjective ophthalmological.
                        <br> An earlier title for this physician, still occasionally used, is oculist, from Latin oculus, eye, a root on which the following English words are also built:
                        <br>1. ocular —an adjective that refers to the eye
                        <br>2. monocle—a lens for one (monos) eye, sported by characters in old movies as a symbol of the British so-called upper class
                        <br>3. binocular —field glasses that increase the range of two (bi-) eyes
                        <br>4. And, strangely enough, inoculate, a word commonly misspelled with two n’s. When you are inoculated against a disease, an “eye,” puncture, or hole is made in your skin, through which serum is injected.<br> Do not confuse
                        the ophthalmologist or oculist, a medical specialist, with two other practitioners who deal with the eye—the optometrist and optician.<br> Optometrists are not physicians, and do not perform surgery or administer drugs; they measure
                        vision, test for glaucoma, and prescribe and fit glasses.<br> Opticians fill an optometrist’s or ophthalmologist’s prescription, grinding lenses according to specifications; they do not examine patients.<br> Optometrist combines
                        Greek opsis, optikos, sight or vision, with metron, measurement—the optometrist, by etymology, is one who measures vision. The specialty is optometry.<br> Optician is built on opsis, optikos, plus -ician, expert. The specialty
                        is optics.<br> Adjectives: optometric or optometrical, optical.</p>
