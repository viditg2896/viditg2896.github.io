                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. the ego</h3>
                    <p>Egoist and egotist are built on the same Latin root—the pronoun ego, meaning I. I is the greatest concern in the egoist’s mind, the most overused word in the egotist’s vocabulary. (Keep the words diϱerentiated in your own mind by thinking
                        of the t in talk, and the additional t in egotist. ) Ego itself has been taken over from Latin as an important English word and is commonly used to denote one’s concept of oneself, as in, “What do you think your constant criticisms
                        do to my ego?” Ego has also a special meaning in psychology—but for the moment you have enough problems without going into that. If you are an egocentric, you consider yourself the center of the universe —you are an extreme form
                        of the egoist. And if you are an egomaniac, you carry egoism to such an extreme that your needs, desires, and interests have become a morbid obsession, a mania. The egoist or egotist is obnoxious, the egocentric is intolerable,
                        and the egomaniac is dangerous and slightly mad. Egocentric is both a noun (“What an egocentric her new roommate is!”) and an adjective (“He is the most egocentric person I have ever met!”). To derive the adjective form of egomaniac,
                        add -al, a common adjective suffix. Say the adjective aloud: egomaniacal
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. others</h3>
                    <p>In Latin, the word for other is alter, and a number of valuable English words are built on this root. Altruism, the philosophy practiced by altruists, comes from one of the variant spellings of Latin alter, other. Altruistic actions
                        look toward the beneϧt of others. If you alternate, you skip one and take the other, so to speak, as when you play golf on alternate (AWL′-tƏr-nƏt) Saturdays. An alternate (AWL′-tƏr-nƏt) in a debate, contest, or convention is the
                        other person who will take over if the original choice is unable to attend. And if you have no alternative (awlTUR′-nƏ-tiv), you have no other choice. You see how easy it is to understand the meanings of these words once you realize
                        that they all come from the same source. And keeping in mind that alter means other, you can quickly understand words like alter ego, altercation, and alteration. An alteration is of course a change—a making into something other.
                        When you alter your plans, you make other plans. An altercation is a verbal dispute. When you have an altercation with someone, you have a violent disagreement, a “ϧght” with words. And why? Because you have other ideas, plans,
                        or opinions than those of the person on the other side of the argument. Altercation, by the way, is stronger than quarrel or dispute—the sentiment is more heated, the disagreement is likely to be angry or even hot-tempered, there
                        may be recourse, if the disputants are human, to profanity or obscenity. You have altercations, in short, over pretty important issues, and the word implies that you get quite excited. Alter ego , which combines alter, other, with
                        ego, I, self, generally refers to someone with whom you are so close that you both do the same things, think alike, react similarly, and are, in temperament, almost mirror images of each other. Any such friend is your other I,
                        your other self, your alter ego.</p>
