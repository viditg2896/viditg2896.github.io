                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. behavior</h3>
                    <p>By education and training, this practitioner is an expert in the dark mysteries of human
                        behavior—what makes people act as they do, why they have certain feelings, how their
                        personalities were formed—in short, what makes them tick. Such a professional is often
                        employed by industries, schools, and institutions to devise means for keeping workers
                        productive and happy, students well-adjusted, and inmates contented. With a state license,
                        this person may also do private or group therapy.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">A psychologist</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. worries, fears, conflicts</h3>
                    <p>This practitioner is a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist who has been specially
                        trained in the techniques devised by Sigmund Freud, encouraging you to delve into that
                        part of your mind called “the unconscious.” By reviewing the experiences, traumas,
                        feelings, and thoughts of your earlier years, you come to a better understanding of your
                        present worries, fears, conϩicts, repressions, insecurities, and nervous tensions—thus taking
                        the ϧrst step in coping with them. Treatment, consisting largely in listening to, and helping
                        you to interpret the meaning of, your free-ϩowing ideas, is usually given in frequent
                        sessions that may well go on for a year or more.</p>

                    <p>This practitioner is a dentist who has taken postgraduate work in the straightening of
                        teeth.</p>

                        you a new and more accurate view of the world.</p>

                        procedures, a technique based on the theory that illness may be caused by the undue
                        pressure of displaced bones on nerves and blood vessels.<br>
                        Training is equal to that of physicians, and in most states these practitioners may also
                        use the same methods as, and have the full rights and privileges of, medical doctors.</p>
