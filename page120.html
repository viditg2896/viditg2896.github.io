                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Ready to go back thirty or more years? Consider some post-World War II American political history:<br> Harry Truman couldn’t win the 1948 election. The pollsters said so, the Republicans heartily agreed, even the Democrats, some in
                        high places, believed it. Mr. Truman himself was perhaps the only voter in the country who was not entirely convinced.<br> Came the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November—well, if you were one of those who stayed up most
                        of the night listening to the returns, and then kept your ear to the radio most of the next day, you recall how you reacted to the unique Truman triumph.<br> It was no mean accomplishment, thought many people. Pure accident, said
                        others. If one out of twelve voters in a few key states had changed his ballot, Harry could have gone back to selling ties, one Republican apologist pointed out. It wasn’t anything Truman did, said another; it was what Dewey didn’t
                        do. No credit to Truman, said a third; it was the farmers —or labor—or the Republicans who hadn’t bothered to vote—or the ingenious miscounting of ballots. No credit to Truman, insisted a fourth; it was Wallace’s candidacy—it was
                        the Democrats—it was Republican overconfidence—it was sunspots—it was the Communists—it was the civil service workers who didn’t want to lose their cushy jobs—it was really Roosevelt who won the election.<br> Anyway Harry didn’t
                        accomplish a thing—he was just a victim of good fortune. What were the apologists for Dewey’s failure doing?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">They were <i>disparaging</i> Truman’s achievement</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. playing it safe</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Willing to look at some more history of the late 1940s?<br> Of course, Dewey did campaign, in his own way, for the presidency. As the Republican aspirant, he had to take a stand on the controversial Taft-Hartley Act.<br> Was he for
                        it? He was for that part of it which was <i>good</i>. Naturally, he was against any of the provisions which were <i>bad</i>. Was he for it? The answer was <i>yes</i>—and also no. Take whichever answer you wanted most to hear.<br>                        What was Dewey doing?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">He was <i>equivocating</i></h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">3. enjoying the little things</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Have you ever gone through a book that was so good you kept hugging yourself mentally as you read? Have you ever seen a play or motion picture that was so charming that you felt sheer delight as you watched? Or perhaps you have had
                        a portion of pumpkin-chiffon pie, light and airy and mildly flavored, and with a flaky, delicious crust, that was the last word in gustatory enjoyment?<br> Now notice the examples I have used. I have not spoken of books that grip
                        you emotionally, of plays and movies that keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense, or of food that satisfies a ravenous hunger. These would offer quite a different, perhaps more lasting and memorable, type of enjoyment. I
                        have detailed, rather, mental or physical stimuli that excite enjoyably but not too sharply—a delightful novel, a charming play, a delicious dessert.<br> How do such things affect you?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">They <i>titillate</i> you.</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">4. playing it way up</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">You know how the teen-agers of an earlier generation adored, idolized, and overwhelmed Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Beatles?<br> And of course you know how certain people fall all over visiting celebrities—best-selling authors,
                        much publicized artists, or famous entertainers. They show them ingratiating, almost servile attention, worship and flatter them fulsomely.<br> How do we say it in a single word?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">They <i>adulate</i> such celebrities.</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">5. accentuating the negative</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">What does the doctor say to you if you have low blood sugar? “No candy, no pastries, no chocolate marshmallow cookies, no ice cream!”, your morale dropping lower and lower as each favorite goody is placed on the forbidden list.<br>                        What, in one word, is the doctor doing?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">The doctor is <i>proscribing</i> harmful items in your diet</h2>
