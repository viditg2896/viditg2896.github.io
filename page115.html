                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. people and the stars</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Anthropologist</i> is constructed from roots we are familiar with—<i>anthropos, mankind, and
                        logos</i>, science, study.<br> The science is <i>anthropology</i>. Can you write the adjective form of this word? __________________. (Can you pronounce it?)<br>
                        <i>Astronomer</i> is built on Greek <i>astron</i>, star, and <i>nomos,</i> arrangement, law, or order. The
                        <i>astronomer</i> is interested in the arrangement of stars and other celestial bodies. The science is
                        <i>astronomy</i>, the adjective is <i>astronomical</i>, a word often used in a non-heavenly sense, as in “the <i>astronomical</i> size of the national debt.” <i>Astronomy</i> deals in such enormous distances (the sun, for example,
                        is 93,000,000 miles from the earth, and light from stars travels toward the earth at 186,000 miles per second) that the adjective astronomical is applied to any tremendously large figure.<br>
                        <i>Astron,</i> star, combines with <i>logos</i> to form <i>astrology</i>, which assesses the influence of planets and stars on human events. The practitioner is an <i>astrologer</i> . Can you form the adjective?___________________.
                        (Can you pronounce it?)<br> By etymology, an <i>astronaut</i> is a sailor among the stars (Greek nautes, sailor).<br> This person is termed with somewhat less exaggeration a <i>cosmonaut</i> by the Russians (Greek, <i>kosmos</i>,
                        universe). <i>Nautical</i>, relating to sailors, sailing, ships, or navigation, derives also from <i>nautes</i>, and <i>nautes</i> in turn is from Greek <i>naus</i>, ship—a root used in <i>nausea</i> (etymologically, ship-sickness
                        or seasickness!).<br>
                        <i>Aster</i> is a star shaped flower.<i> Asterisk </i>, a star-shaped symbol (*), is generally used in writing or printing to direct the reader to look for a footnote. <i>Astrophysics</i> is that branch of physics dealing with
                        heavenly bodies.<br>
                        <i>Disaster</i> and <i>disastrous</i> also come from <i>astron</i>, star. In ancient times it was believed that the stars ruled human destiny; any misfortune or calamity, therefore, happened to someone because the stars were in
                        opposition. (<i>Dis-</i>, a prefix of many meanings, in this word signifies against.)<br>
                        <i>Nomos</i>, arrangement, law, or order, is found in two other interesting English words.<br> For example, if you can make your own laws for yourself, if you needn’t answer to anyone else for what you do, in short, if you are
                        independent, then you enjoy <i>autonomy</i> , a word that combines <i>nomos</i>, law, with <i>autos</i>, self. <i>Autonomy,</i> then, is selflaw, self-government. The fifty states in our nation are fairly <i>autonomous</i>, but
                        not completely so. On the other hand, in most colleges each separate department is pretty much <i>autonomous</i>. And of course, one of the big reasons for the revolution of 1776 was that America wanted autonomy, rather than control
                        by England.<br> You know the instrument that beginners at the piano use to guide their timing? A pendulum swings back and forth, making an audible click at each swing, and in that way governs or orders the measure (or timing) of
                        the player. Hence it is called a <i>metronome</i>, a word that combines <i>nomos</i> with <i>metron</i>, measurement.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. the earth and it's life</h3>
                    <p class="main_para"><i>Geologist</i> derives from Greek <i>ge (geo-)</i>, earth. The science is <i>geology</i>. Can you write the adjective? ____________________________________. (Can you pronounce it?)<br>
                        <i>Geometry —ge</i> plus <i>metron—</i>by etymology “measurement of the earth,” is that branch of mathematics treating of the measurement and properties of solid and plane figures, such as angles, triangles, squares, spheres, prisms,
                        etc. (The etymology of the word shows that this ancient science was originally concerned with the measurement of land and spaces on the earth.)<br> The mathematician is a <i>geometrician</i>, the adjective is <i>geometric</i>.<br>
                        <i>Geography </i> is writing about (<i>graphein</i>, to write), or mapping, the earth. A practitioner of the science is a <i>geographer</i>, the adjective is <i>geographic</i>.
                        <br>(The name George is also derived from <i>ge (geo-)</i>, earth, plus <i>ergon,</i> work—the first George was an earth-worker or farmer.)<br>
                        <i>Biologist</i> combines <i>bios,</i> life, with <i>logos</i>, science, study. The science is biology. The adjective? __________________.<br>
                        <i>Bios</i>, life, is also found in <i>biography</i>, writing about someone’s life;
                        <i>autobiography</i>, the story of one’s life written by oneself; and <i>biopsy</i>, a medical examination, or view (<i>opsis</i>, <i>optikos</i>, view, vision), generally through a microscope, of living tissue, frequently performed
                        when cancer is suspected. A small part of the tissue is cut from the affected area and under the microscope its cells can be investigated for evidence of malignancy. A biopsy is contrasted with an <i>autopsy</i>, which is a medical
                        examination of a corpse in order to discover the cause of death. The <i>autos</i> in <i>autopsy</i> means, as you know, self—in an <i>autopsy</i>, etymologically speaking, the surgeon or pathologist determines, by actual view or
                        sight rather than by theorizing (i.e., “by viewing or seeing for oneself”), what brought the corpse to its present grievous state.<br>
                        <i>Botanist</i> is from Greek <i>botane</i>, plant. The field is <i>botany</i>; the adjective is
                        <i>botanical</i>.<br>
                        <i>Zoologist</i> is from Greek <i>zoion</i>, animal. The science is <i>zoology</i>. The adjective? __________________. The combination of the two o’s tempts many people to pronounce the first three letters of these words in one
                        syllable, thus: <i>zoo.</i> However, the two o’s should be separated, as in cooperate, even though no hyphen is used in the spelling to indicate such separation.<i> Zoo,</i> a park for animals, is a shortened form of
                        <i>zoological</i> gardens, and is, of course, pronounced in one syllable.<br> The <i>zodiac</i> is a diagram, used in astrology, of the paths of the sun, moon, and planets; it contains, in part, Latin names for various animals—scorpio,
                        scorpion;<i> leo,</i> lion; <i>cancer</i>, crab; <i>taurus</i>, bull; aries, ram; and pisces, ϧsh. Hence its derivation from zoion, animal.
                        <br> The adjective is <i>zodiacal</i>.</p>
