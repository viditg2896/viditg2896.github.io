                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. of time and place</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">A <i>chronic</i> liar lies constantly, again and again and again; a <i>chronic</i> invalid is ill time after time, frequently, repeatedly. The derivation of the word is Greek <i>chronos</i>, time. The noun form is <i>chronicity</i>.<br>                        An <i>anachronism</i> is someone or something out of time, out of date, belonging to a different era, either earlier or later. (The prefix <i>ana-</i> like <i>a-</i>, is negative.) The adjective is <i>anachronous </i>or <i>anachronistic</i>.<br>                        Wander along Fifty-ninth Street and Central Park in Manhattan some Sunday. You will see horse-drawn carriages with top-hatted coachmen—a vestige of the 1800s. Surrounded by twentieth-century motorcars and modern skyscrapers, these
                        romantic vehicles of a bygone era are <i>anachronous</i>.<br> Read a novel in which a scene is supposedly taking place in the nineteenth century and see one of the characters turning on a TV set. An <i>anachronism!</i><br> Your
                        friend talks, thinks, dresses, and acts as if he were living in the time of Shakespeare. Another <i>anachronism!</i><br> Science fiction is deliberately <i>anachronous</i>—it deals with phenomena, gadgetry, accomplishments far
                        off (possibly) in the future.<br> An <i>anachronism</i> is out of time; something out of place is <i>incongruous</i>, a word combining the negative prefix <i>in-</i>, the prefix ,<i>con-</i>, with or together, and a Latin verb
                        meaning to <i>agree or correspond</i>.<br> Thus, it is <i>incongruous</i> to wear a sweater and slacks to a formal wedding; it is <i>anachronous</i> to wear the wasp waist, conspicuous bustle, or powdered wig of the eighteenth
                        century. The noun form of <i>incongruous</i> is <i>incongruity</i>.<br>
                        <i>Chronological</i>, in correct time order, comes from <i>chronos</i>. To tell a story
                        <i>chronologically</i> is to relate the events in the time order of their occurrence. <i>Chronology</i> is the science of time order and the accurate dating of events (logos, science)— the expert in this field is a <i>chronologist</i>—or
                        a list of events in the time order in which they have occurred or will occur.<br> A <i>chronometer</i>, combining <i>chronos</i> with <i>metron</i>, measurement, is a highly accurate timepiece, especially one used on ships. <i>Chronometry</i>                        is the measurement of time—the adjective is <i>chronometric</i>.<br> Add the prefix <i>syn-</i>, together, plus the verb suffix <i>-ize</i>, to <i>chronos</i>, and you have constructed <i>synchronize</i>, etymologically to time
                        together, or to move, happen, or cause to happen, at the same time or rate. If you and your friend <i>synchronize</i> your watches, you set them at the same time. If you <i>synchronize</i> the activity of your arms and legs, as
                        in swimming, you move them at the same time or rate. The adjective is <i>synchronous</i>; the noun form of the verb <i>synchronize</i> is <i>synchronization</i></p>


                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2.disease, sufferingm teeling</h3>
                    <p class="main_para"><i>Pathological</i> is diseased (a <i>pathological</i> condition)—this meaning of the word ignores the root <i>logos</i>, science, study.<br>
                        <i>Pathology</i> is the science or study of disease—its nature, cause, cure, etc. However, another meaning of the noun ignores <i>logos</i>, and <i>pathology</i> may be any morbid, diseased, or abnormal physical condition or conditions;
                        in short, simply disease, as in “This case involves so many kinds of <i>pathology</i> that several different specialists are working on it.”
                        <br> A <i>pathologist</i> is an expert who examines tissue, often by autopsy or biopsy, to diagnose disease and interpret the abnormalities in such tissue that may be caused by specific diseases.<br>
                        <i>Pathos </i>occurs in some English words with the additional meaning of feeling. If you feel or suffer with someone, you are <i>sympathetic —sym-</i> is a respelling before the letter p of the Greek prefix<i> syn-</i>, with or
                        together. The noun is <i>sympathy</i>, the verb <i>sympathize</i>. Husbands, for example, so the story goes, may have
                        <i>sympathetic</i> labor pains when their wives are about to deliver.<br> The prefix <i>anti-</i>, you will recall, means against. If you experience <i>antipathy</i> to people or things, you feel against them—you feel strong dislike
                        or hostility. The adjective is <i>antipathetic</i>, as in “an <i>antipathetic</i> reaction to an authority figure.”<br> But you may have no feeling at all—just indifference, lack of any interest, emotion, or response, complete
                        listlessness, especially when some reaction is normal or expected. Then you are <i>apathetic</i>; <i>a-</i>, as you know, is a negative prefix. The noun is <i>apathy</i> , as in voter <i>apathy</i>, student <i>apathy</i>, etc.<br>                        On the other hand, you may be so sensitive or perceptive that you not only share the feelings of another, but you also identify with those feelings, in fact experience them yourself as if momentarily you were that other person.
                        What you have, then, is <i>empathy</i>; you <i>empathize</i>, you are <i>empathetic</i>, or, to use an alternate adjective, <i>empathic</i>. <i>Em-</i> is a respelling before the letter p of the Greek prefix <i>en-, in</i>.<br>                        Someone is <i>pathetic</i> who is obviously suffering—such a person may arouse
                        <i>sympathy</i> or pity (or perhaps <i>antipathy</i>?) in you. A <i>pathetic</i> story is about suffering and, again, is likely to arouse sadness, sorrow, or pity.<br> Some interesting research was done many years ago by Dr. J.
                        B. Rhine and his associates at Duke University on extrasensory perception; you will ϧnd an interesting account of Rhine’s work in his book The Reach of the Mind. What makes it possible for two people separated by miles of space
                        to communicate with each other without recourse to messenger, telephone, telegraph, or postal service? It can be done, say the believers in <i>telepathy</i>, also called mental <i>telepathy</i>, though they do not yet admit to
                        knowing how. How can one person read the mind of another? Simple—by being <i>telepathic</i>, but no one can explain the chemistry or biology of it. <i>Telepathy</i> is built by combining <i>pathos</i>, feeling, with the prefix
                        <i>tele-</i>, distance, the same prefix we found in <i>telephone, telegraph,
                        telescope</i>.<br>
                        <i>Telepathic</i> communication occurs when people can <i>feel</i> each other’s thoughts from a distance, when they have ESP</p>
