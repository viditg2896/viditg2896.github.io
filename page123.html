                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. more on equality</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">The root <i>aequus</i>, spelled<i> equ-</i> in English words, is a building block of:
                        <br>1. <i>equity</i>—justice, fairness; i.e., equal treatment. (By extension, stocks in the financial markets are <i>equities</i>, and the value of your home or other property over and above the amount of the mortgage you owe is
                        your <i>equity</i> in it.) The adjective is <i>equitable</i>.
                        <br>2 . <i>inequity</i>—injustice, unfairness (<i>equity</i> plus the negative prefix <i>in-</i>). Adjective:
                        <i> inequitable</i>.
                        <br>3. <i>iniquity</i>—by one of those delightful surprises and caprices characteristic of language, the change of a single letter (e to i), extends the meaning of a word far beyond its derivation and original denotation. Injustice
                        and unfairness are sinful and wicked, especially if you naïvely believe that life is fair. So a “den of <i>iniquity</i>” is a place where vice flourishes; an <i>iniquity</i> is a sin or vice, or an egregiously immoral act; and
                        <i>iniquity</i> is wickedness, sinfulness. Adjective: <i>iniquitous</i>.
                        <br>4 . <i>equinox</i>—etymologically, “equal night,” a combination of <i>aequus</i> and
                        <i>nox, noctis</i>, night. The <i>equinox</i>, when day and night are of equal length, occurs twice a year: about March 21, and again about September 21 or 22. (The adjective is <i>equinoctial—</i>)
                        <i>Nocturnal</i>, derived from <i>nox, noctis,</i> describes people, animals, or plants that are active or flourish at night rather than during daylight hours. Cats and owls are <i>nocturnal,</i> as is the moonflower, whose blossoms
                        open at night; not to mention “night people,” whose biorhythms are such that they function better after the sun goes down, and who like to stay up late and sleep well into midmorning. A <i>nocturne</i> is a musical composition
                        of dreamy character (i.e., night music), or a painting of a night scene.
                        <br>5 . <i>equanimity</i>—etymologically <i>aequus</i> plus
                        <i>animus</i>, mind, hence “equal mind.” Maintain your <i>equanimity,</i> your evenness of temper, your composure, your coolness or calmness, when everyone around you is getting excited or hysterical, and you will probably be considered
                        an admirable person, though one might wonder what price you pay for such emotional control.
                        <br>6 . <i>Equability</i>—a close synonym of <i>equanimity.</i> A person of <i>equable</i> temperament is characteristically calm, serene, unflappable, even-tempered.
                        <br>7 . <i>equilibrium</i>—by derivation <i>aequus</i> plus <i>libra</i>, balance, weight, pound, hence “equal balance.” <i>Libra</i> is the seventh sign of the zodiac, represented by a pair of scales. Now you know, in case the
                        question has been bothering you, why the abbreviation for the word pound is <i>lb</i>. and why the symbol for the British pound, the monetary unit, is £. <i>Equilibrium</i> is a state of physical balance, especially between opposing
                        forces. When you are very drunk you may have diϫculty keeping your <i>equilibrium—</i>the force of gravity is stronger than your ability to stay upright. An <i>equilibrist</i>, as you might guess, is a professional tightrope walker—a
                        performer successfully defying the law of gravity (when sober) by balancing on a thin overhead wire.<br> The <i>equator</i> divides the earth into equal halves, and words like <i>equation, equivalent</i>, equidistant, equiangular,
                        and equilateral (from Latin latus, lateris, side) are self-explanatory.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. not to be confused with horses</h3>
                    <p class="main_para"><i>Equestrian</i> is someone on a horse (as pedestrian is someone on foot); an
                        <i>equestrienne</i> is a woman on a horse (if you must make the distinction); and <i>equine</i> is like a horse, as in appearance or characteristics, or descriptive of horses.
                        <br>
                        <i>Equestrian</i>is also an adjective referring to horseback riding, as an<i> equestrian</i> statue; and
                        <i>equine</i> is also a noun, i.e., a horse.<br> So the <i>equ-</i> in these words, from Latin <i>equus</i>, horse, is not to be confused with the <i>equ-</i> in the words of the previous section—that <i>equ-</i> is from <i>aequus</i>,
                        <i>equal</i>. (Remember, also, not to confuse the <i>ped-</i> in <i>pedestrian</i>, from Latin <i>pedis</i>, foot, with the <i>ped-</i> in <i>pediatrician,</i> from Greek paidos, child.)</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">3. hear voices?</h3>
                    <p class="main_para"><i>Equivocal</i>, you will recall, combines <i>aequus</i> with <i>vox, vocis, voice;</i> and vox, vocis combines with <i>fero</i>, to bear or carry, to form <i>vociferous</i>, etymologically “carrying (much) voice,” hence loud, noisy,
                        clamorous, as <i>vociferous</i> demands (not at all quiet or subtle), or the <i>vociferous</i> play of young children (“Please! Try to be quiet so Dad can get his work done!”), though unfortunately TV addiction has abnormally eliminated
                        child noises, at least during the program breaks between commercials.
                        <br>If you are <i>vocal</i>, you express yourself readily and freely by voice; <i>vocal sounds
                         are voiced</i>; <i>vocal music</i> is sung; and you know what your <i>vocal</i> cords are for.
                        <br>To <i>vocalize</i> is to give voice to (<i>“Vocalize</i> your anger, don’t hold it in!”), or to sing the <i>vocals</i> (or voice parts) of music. (Can you write the noun form of the verb <i>vocalize</i>? __________________.)
                        A <i>vocalist</i> is a singer. And Magnavox (<i>vox</i> plus <i>magnus</i>, large) is the trade name for a brand of radios and TV sets.</p>
