                    <h2 class="section-heading">ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</h2>
                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">1. well-known</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">“Widely but unfavorably known” is the common definition for <i>notorious</i>. Just as a
                        <i>notorious</i> liar is well-known for unreliable statements, so a <i>notorious</i> gambler, a <i>notorious</i> thief, or a <i>notorious</i> killer has achieved a wide reputation for some form of antisocial behavior. The noun
                        is <i>notoriety </i>.<br> The derivation is from Latin <i>notus</i>, known, from which we also get noted. It is an interesting characteristic of some words that a change of syllables can alter the emotional impact. Thus, an admirer
                        of certain business executives will speak of them as <i>“noted</i> industrialists”; these same people’s enemies will call them <i>“notorious</i> exploiters.” Similarly, if we admire a man’s or a woman’s unworldliness, we refer
                        to it by the complimentary term
                        <i>childlike</i>; but if we are annoyed by the trait, we describe it, derogatively, as <i>childish</i>. Change “-like” to “-ish” and our emotional tone undergoes a complete reversal.</p>


                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">2. plenty of room at the top</h3>
                    <p class="main_para">The top of a mountain is called, as you know, the <i>summit</i>, a word derived from Latin
                        <i> summus</i>, highest, which also gives us the mathematical term <i>sum,</i> as in addition. A
                        <i>consummate</i> artist has reached the very highest point of perfection; and to <i>consummate</i> a marriage, a business deal, or a contract is, etymologically, to bring it to the highest point; that is, to put the final touches
                        to it, to bring it to completion.<br> Nouns are formed from adjectives by the addition of the noun suffix <i>-ness: sweet—
                        sweetness; simple—simpleness; envious—enviousness;</i> etc.<br> Many adjectives, however, have alternate noun forms, and the adjective<i> consummate</i> is one of them. To make a noun out of <i>consummate,</i> add either <i>-ness or -acy;</i>                        <i>consummateness</i> or <i>consummacy</i>.<br> Verbs ending in <i>-ate </i>invariably tack on the noun suffix <i>-ion</i> to form nouns: <i>create—
                        creation; evaluate—evaluation;</i> etc.<br> Can you write the noun form of the verb to <i>consummate</i>?<br> ________________
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">3. no help</h3>
                    <p class="main_para">Call people <i>incorrigible </i>if they do anything to excess, and if all efforts to correct or reform them are to no avail. Thus, one can be an <i>incorrigible</i> idealist, an
                        <i>incorrigible</i> criminal, an <i>incorrigible</i> optimist, or an <i>incorrigible</i> philanderer. The word derives from Latin <i>corrigo</i>, to correct or set straight, plus the negative prefix <i>in-</i>. (This prefix, depending
                        on the root it precedes, may be negative, may intensify the root, as in <i>invaluable</i>, or may mean in.)<br> The noun is <i>incorrigibility</i> or, alternatively, <i>incorrigibleness</i>.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">4. veterans</h3>
                    <p class="main_para"><i>Inveterate,</i> from Latin <i>vetus</i>, old, generally indicates disapproval.<br>
                        <i>Inveterate</i> gamblers have grown old in the habit, etymologically speaking; <i>inveterate</i> drinkers have been imbibing for so long that they, too, have formed old, well-established habits; and <i>inveterate</i> liars have
                        been lying for so long, and their habits are by now so deeprooted, that one can scarcely remember (the word implies) when they ever told the truth.
                        <br>The noun is <i>inveteracy </i>or <i>inveterateness</i>.<br> A <i>veteran</i>, as of the Armed Forces, grew older serving the country; otherwise a <i>veteran</i> is an old hand at the game (and therefore skillful). The word
                        is both a noun and an adjective: a <i>veteran</i> at (or in) swimming, tennis, police work, business, negotiations, diplomacy—or a <i>veteran</i> actor, teacher, diplomat, political reformer.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">5. birth</h3>
                    <p class="main_para">Greek <i>genesis</i>, birth or origin, a root we discovered in discussing <i>psychogenic</i>, is the source of a great many English words.<br>
                        <i>Genetics</i> is the science that treats of the transmission of hereditary characteristics from parents to offspring. The scientist specializing in the field is a <i>geneticist</i>, the adjective is <i>genetic</i>. The particle
                        in the chromosome of the germ cell containing a hereditary characteristic is a <i>gene</i>.<br>
                        <i>Genealogy </i>is the study of family trees or ancestral origins (<i>logos</i>, study). The practitioner is a <i>genealogist</i>. Can you form the adjective? __________________.
                        <br> The <i>genital</i>, or sexual, organs are involved in the process of conception and birth. The <i>genesis</i> of anything—a plan, idea, thought, career, etc.—is its beginning, birth, or origin, and <i>Genesis</i>, the first
                        book of the Old Testament, describes the creation, or birth, of the universe.<br>
                        <i>Congenital</i> is constructed by combining the prefix <i>con-</i>, with or together, and the root
                        <i> genesis</i>, birth.<br> So a <i>congenital</i> defect, deformity, condition, etc. occurs during the nine-month birth process (or period of gestation, to become technical). <i>Hereditary</i> characteristics, on the other hand,
                        are acquired at the moment of conception. Thus, eye color, nose shape, hair texture, and other such qualities are <i>hereditary</i>; they are determined by the <i>genes</i> in the germ cells of the mother and father. But a thalidomide
                        baby resulted from the use of the drug by a pregnant woman, so the deformities were congenital.<br>
                        <i>Congenital</i> is used both literally and figuratively. Literally, the word generally refers to some medical deformity or abnormality occurring during gestation. Figuratively, it wildly exaggerates, for effect, the very early
                        existence of some quality: <i>congenital</i> liar,<i> congenital</i> fear of the dark, etc.</p>
