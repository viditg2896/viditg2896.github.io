                    <p style="text-align:justify;">You are warm, friendly, enthusiastic, outgoing, easy to please; you are quick to show appreciation, yet accept, without judgment or criticism, the human weaknesses of others.<br> You are a fascinating talker, an even better listener.<br>                        You believe in, and practice, honest self-disclosure; you feel comfortable with yourself and therefore with everyone else; and you have a passionate interest in experiencing, in living, in relating to people.<br> Need you have
                        any fears about making friends? Obviously not</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">Your characteristics and temperament <i>obviate</i> such fears.</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">7. playing it wrong</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Theodor Reik, in his penetrating book on psychoanalysis <i>Listening with the Third Ear,</i> talks about neurotic people who unconsciously wish to fail. In business interviews they say exactly the wrong words, they do exactly the wrong
                        things, they seem intent (as,
                        <i>unconsciously</i>, they actually are) on insuring failure in every possible way, though consciously they are doing their best to court success.<br> What effect does such a neurotic tendency have?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">it <i>militates</i> against success.</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">8. playing it dirty</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">“Harry?”<i> He’s a closet alcoholic</i>. Maud?<i> She’s sleeping around</i>—and her stupid husband doesn’t suspect a thing. Bill?<i> He’s embezzling from his own company</i>. Paul?<i> He’s a child
                        molester</i>. Sally? You don’t know that <i>she’s a notorious husband-beater</i>?” What is this character doing?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">he's <i>maligning</i> everyone</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">9. giving the benefit of any doubt </h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Do you think it’s all right to cheat on your income taxes? At least just a little? It’s wrong, of course, but doesn’t everybody do it?<br> How do you feel about marital infidelity? Are you inclined to overlook the occasional philandering
                        of the male partner, since, after all, to invent a cliché, men are essentially polygamous by nature?<br> If your answers are in the <i>affirmative</i>, how are you reacting to such legal or ethical transgressions?
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">you <i>condone</i> them.</h2>

                    <h3 class="section-heading idea_title">10. changing hostility</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Unwittingly you have done something that has aroused anger and resentment in your best friend. You had no desire to hurt him, yet he makes it obvious that he feels pretty bitter about the whole situation. (Perhaps you failed to invite
                        him to a gathering he wanted to come to; or you neglected to consult him before making a decision on a matter in which he felt he should have some say.) His friendship is valuable to you and you wish to restore yourself in his
                        good graces. What do you do?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading idea_word">you try to <i>placate</i> him.</h2>
